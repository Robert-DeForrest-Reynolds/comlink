# comlink
A utility for communicating with text editors a project's external comments

### What is the point?

Because I think documentation, and commenting is important. The thing is, it's incredibly subjective. All comments being there benefits everyone, but everyone personally only needs few comments here and there on things they specifically don't understand.
As well, for incredibly large, and convoluted projects, it could prove very fruitful to have a heavily-detailed documentation embedded within the source files, but bloating the files themselves has always been a problem.

I made comlink to try to solve that problem, and well, just because I wanted to. I find this tool very useful myself, and that's enough to make it.
